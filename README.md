I am still undecided as to what I want to make, though fiction is likely.

Science fiction is *very* tempting. Or something very cartoon-ish with sound effects. That could be fun.

1/16/20 Update - I think I would like to tell a sci-fi story about a spacewalk, because I'd love to play with deafening silence that space might provide. Open with music as they get ready for the day, stay with music until some hydraulic sound of a door opening, and as the astronaut steps outside, an overwhelming silence with possible fading in music for the beauty of space.

I need to find a way to communicate that they are in space before the moment comes, because it would otherwise come out of nowhere (you don't assume people are in space, normally).
