** I am using this document as my "journal" for the project. Updates found here.

**1/28/20 Update** - It is very late, but I have finished my first full draft and am prepared for class in about 12 hours. I have put a lot of work into this project, and likewise, I have put a lot of procrastination into it as well. That said, I am actually very happy about the result. So, here's an introduction:

The setting of this soundscape is in space, specifically on a space station. You get to see some parts of an astronaut's life that isn't too dissimilar from our own (waking up, eating, exercising), as well as some things unique to an astronaut, i.e. diagnostic checks and, most notably, a spacewalk! The culmination of the narrative is when the astronaut actually goes out on a spacewalk for the first time.

While this is certainly a fictional piece, I'd like to think that at some point, an astronaut has gone through similar experiences, although extensive training probably prepared them very well for when the time came. I don't know how well training can prepare anyone for an experience like floating out in open space, which I hoped to capture with this narrative. You see (or hear, rather) the astronaut go through their day normally and only really see their comfort waver when it's time for the spacewalk.

I know touch-ups are yet to be done, but I honestly have really enjoyed learning Audacity and getting to experiment with sound mixing and sound effects. Again, I'm very happy with the result of the soundscape, but I'm sure there's room for improvement and can't wait to hear what positive feedback might come my way.

**1/23/20 Update** - I began working on the Audacity project for this week's preview. There is not much progress yet, but I have taken time to choose what sound effects and background music I want to use. The preview screenshot shows my background music separated into two tracks (left and right) so the right track can be faded out first. This communicates the effect of moving away from the music, before it fades out entirely. The music moves to one ear after the door opens, i.e. the astronaut exiting the door, and the music fades entirely after the door closes and leaves earshot.

Earlier, the sound of a cabinet opening and closing exists, but still needs more filler sounds. My friend agreed to record some voice lines for me to use throughout the soundscape. One line I plan on having him record, for when the cabinet is opened, is him searching through the cabinet for the day's food. A simple line such as, "Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Here it is," followed by the sound of eating after the door closes.

I left only a temporary gap in the music, rather than deleting the rest entirely, in case I needed to lengthen or shorten the beginning before the astronaut exits the door into space. After the astronaut enters the space walk, the purposeful silence has a strong effect compared to the previously constant background music. At this point, I hope to slowly fade in more background music, but more slow and meaningful compared to the more funky and upbeat background music in the introduction. This slow background music could contain a voiceover from the astronaut, though I am not totally decided on this idea.

The immediate to-do list for my soundscape is to get some recorded audio lines from my friend and find some more content to fill before the spacewalk. I'd like to have an, "All clear," line or something to a similar effect before he steps out of the door.


**1/16/20 Update** - I think I would like to tell a sci-fi story about a spacewalk, because I'd love to play with deafening silence that space might provide. Open with music as they get ready for the day, stay with music until some hydraulic sound of a door opening, and as the astronaut steps outside, an overwhelming silence with possible fading in music for the beauty of space.

I need to find a way to communicate that they are in space before the moment comes, because it would otherwise come out of nowhere (you don't assume people are in space, normally).


**Starter thoughts** - I am still undecided as to what I want to make, though fiction is likely.

Science fiction is *very* tempting. Or something very cartoon-ish with sound effects. That could be fun.
