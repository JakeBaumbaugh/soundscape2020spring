** I am using this document as my "journal" for the project. Updates found here.

I am still undecided as to what I want to make, though fiction is likely.

Science fiction is *very* tempting. Or something very cartoon-ish with sound effects. That could be fun.

1/16/20 Update - I think I would like to tell a sci-fi story about a spacewalk, because I'd love to play with deafening silence that space might provide. Open with music as they get ready for the day, stay with music until some hydraulic sound of a door opening, and as the astronaut steps outside, an overwhelming silence with possible fading in music for the beauty of space.

I need to find a way to communicate that they are in space before the moment comes, because it would otherwise come out of nowhere (you don't assume people are in space, normally).


1/23/20 Update - I began working on the Audacity project for this week's preview. There is not much progress yet, but I have taken time to choose what sound effects and background music I want to use. The preview screenshot shows my background music separated into two tracks (left and right) so the right track can be faded out first. This communicates the effect of moving away from the music, before it fades out entirely. The music moves to one ear after the door opens, i.e. the astronaut exiting the door, and the music fades entirely after the door closes and leaves earshot.

Earlier, the sound of a cabinet opening and closing exists, but still needs more filler sounds. My friend agreed to record some voice lines for me to use throughout the soundscape. One line I plan on having him record, for when the cabinet is opened, is him searching through the cabinet for the day's food. A simple line such as, "Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Here it is," followed by the sound of eating after the door closes.

I left only a temporary gap in the music, rather than deleting the rest entirely, in case I needed to lengthen or shorten the beginning before the astronaut exits the door into space. After the astronaut enters the space walk, the purposeful silence has a strong effect compared to the previously constant background music. At this point, I hope to slowly fade in more background music, but more slow and meaningful compared to the more funky and upbeat background music in the introduction. This slow background music could contain a voiceover from the astronaut, though I am not totally decided on this idea.

The immediate to-do list for my soundscape is to get some recorded audio lines from my friend and find some more content to fill before the spacewalk. I'd like to have an, "All clear," line or something to a similar effect before he steps out of the door.
