## A Typical Day...?

*Alarm clock beeps*

*Button click, end alarm*

*Person yawns*

*Fade in funky background music*

*Rolling metal cabinet door opens*

"Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday... okay, Thursday, there it is."

*Rolling metal cabinet door shuts*

*Crunching noises*

*Background music jumps to right ear*

"Foxtrot-Romeo-7 to Home, checking in for diagnostics."

"Copy that. Read out the number on display Hotel-4."

"Uh, 56.3."

"Press November-5. And, uh, read the number again."

*Button click* "52.9"

"Uh, read out display Charlie-9."

"Uhh, 65.1."

"And press Whiskey-11."

*Button click* "71.2."

"Diagnostics complete. Carry on."

*Background music jumps to left ear*

*Exercise machine moving and heavy breathing*

*Maching and breathing ends, background music jumps back to center*

"Tethering now. Stand by."

*Handheld clicking noises*

"Okay, tethered on. Awaiting instruction."

"Are you ready?"

*Exhale* "As I'll ever be."

"You're all clear."

(hesitantly) "Copy that."

*Heavy breath in anticipation*

*Airlock door opens*

*Music moves to left ear as it fades out*

*Airlock door closes at left*

*Silence*

*Fade in dramatic background music*

*Background music fades out*
